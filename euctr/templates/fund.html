{% block social_description %}
        By EU law, from December 2016, all trials on the European Union Clinical
        Trials Register (EUCTR) must post results within 12 months of completion.
        This is the first legislation enacted anywhere in the world which requires
        such trial publication.

        EU Trials Tracker shows which organisations are compliant and which
        aren't.  Help us get funding to continue this work.

  <p class="lead">
    We think transparency and accountability are the key to improving science. We are a small, dedicated, effective team at the University of Oxford.
  </p>
  <p>
    With more funds we could do all of the following:
  </p>

  <h3>New Trackers!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Deliver more new automated trackers
    </li>
    <li>
      Deliver more new manually curated trackers
    </li>
    <li>
      Offer a bespoke “auditing service” to institutions and funders
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Advocacy and Impact!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do more campaign activity around each new tracker, and each new data update, with <a href="http://www.alltrials.net">AllTrials</a></li>
    <li>Chase the researchers and funders of individual unreported trials, to ask them why they haven’t reported their results, and document their responses</li>
    <li>Make our existing Trackers more attractive!</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Better Trackers!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add new features to our existing Trackers</li>
    <li>Invest more in our work that uses AI and Machine Learning to spot unreported trials</li>
    <li>Do more frequent updates on our manual trackers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>More Targets!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a central site, with a page for every company, showing all their scores in one place</li>
    <li>Make a central site, with a page for every treatment, and disease, where you can see whether the trials are all reported</li>
    <li>Shine a spotlight on individual funders, including non-commercial funders, to compare their performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deliver Faster!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We are a small dedicated team</li>
    <li>Dealing with journals, regulators, and the rest, takes a lot of time</li>
    <li>With more funding, and more stable funding, we can expand, and deliver everything we already deliver: but faster, better, bigger, and with more impact!</li>
  </ul>
