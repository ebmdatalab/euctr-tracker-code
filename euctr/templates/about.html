        By EU law, from December 2016, all trials on the European Union Clinical
        Trials Register (EUCTR) must post results within 12 months of completion.
        This is the first legislation enacted anywhere in the world which requires
        such trial publication.

        EU Trials Tracker shows which organisations are compliant and which
        aren't.

                <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/make-journals-report-clinical-trials-properly-1.19280">ongoing global public health problem</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The best currently available evidence shows that around
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25536072">
          half of all trials</a> go unreported: this means that doctors
          and patients see only a partial, biased fraction of the true
          evidence. We cannot make informed decisions about treatments
          unless all the data is reported.  Under EU rules, from
          December 2016, all trials on
          the <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">European
          Union Clinical Trials Register</a> (EUCTR) should post
          results within 12 months of completion.  There has never
          been a rule as simple and clear as this, anywhere in the
          world. Our EU Trials Tracker shows which organisations are
          compliant, and which
          aren't. Our <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3218">paper
          in the BMJ</a> analysed the data as of January 2018, and
          found that <strong>only 49%</strong> of Europe's clinical
          trials reported results in the register.

        <h2 id="clinical-trial">What is a Clinical Trial?</h2>
        <p>
          Clinical trials are the gold standard in medicine: they are
          the most fair test of whether a treatment really works; they
          are also used to assess how one treatment compares to other
          available options. In a clinical trial, the treatment is
          usually given to real patients, in a real-world setting. The
          outcomes measured are ideally real-world problems that
          matter to patients, such as pain, disability or death; but
          can also include lab tests, or scans.
        </p>

        <h2 id="important">Why Do We Need All Trials Reported?</h2>

        <p>
          We use the results of clinical trials to make real-world
          decisions about which treatments work best. We can’t make
          informed choices if the results of clinical trials are
          withheld from doctors, researchers, and patients. Read more
          about this from the <a href="https://alltrials.net">AllTrials Campaign</a>.

        <p>Email us! <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">hello@ebmdatalab.net</a>. We'd particularly
        like to hear about any errors, omissions or ideas.
        </p>

        <h2 id="when-updated">When Was The Data Last Updated?</h2>
        <p>This data updates regularly, on a monthly cycle. We think
        it’s important that information about who is reporting
        clinical trials is current and regularly updated: so that
        sponsors are always motivated to improve; and sponsors who do
        improve can see their good work reflected in public. The
        current data was taken from the register starting on {{ scrape_date }}.
        All clinical trials on medicinal products (drugs and vaccines) conducted
        in Europe since 2004 are in the register. For full details, see the
        register's
        <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/about.html">about page</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="due">What Does “Due” Mean?</h2>
        <p>When more than a year has passed since the completion of a
        trial, the results should be published, and we call it
        "due". Specifically, we take the latest “global end of trial
        date” listed for the trial; then add a year (the maximum delay
        permitted for sponsors to report results); and finally add 4
        weeks (the statutory maximum 15 days administrative delay for
        results to be published on the register by the regulator, and
        another 5 days to allow for national holidays and exceptional
        circumstances). Currently, any trial completed earlier than
        {{ due_date_cutoff }} is due. You can read a detailed description
        of the way we assess an individual trial
        <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/09/27/utotw-gabapentin-for-cerebellar-ataxia-in-degenerative-and-inflammatory-cns-disease/">
        here</a></p>

        <h2 id="major-sponsor">What’s a Major Sponsor?</h2>
        <p>The initial table on the front page shows only sponsors
        with 50 or more total trials in the register. This is to make
        the headline rankings more easily viewable. If you click “all
        sponsors” you can see all sponsors! This is a list of
        thousands, so we have also made a search box where you can
        find a sponsor you are particularly interested in.
        </p>

        <h2 id="inconsistent-data">What does “Inconsistent Data” Mean for a Trial?</h2>

        <p>“Inconsistent Data” means that we cannot definitively say the
           trial is due to report with the data provided on the EUCTR. This
           could be for any number of reasons involving the sponsor (for not
           providing timely and accurate information), national competent
           authorities (for failing to quality control submissions or update entries),
           and/or the design and implementation of the EUCTR itself:</p>

        <p>Currently, we identify the following issues:

        <ol>
          <li>A trial in which all sites are either “completed” or “terminated”
          but no “Date of the global end of the trial” is provided. The results
          page of a trial may also contain a “global trial end date” field however
          this is not currently included in our analysis as it is unclear how
          this date is provided and quality controlled. Information provided in
          the country protocols, including the “Date of the global end of the trial,”
          must first pass through a national competent authority.</li>
          <li>A trial has a “Date of the global end of the trial” listed, however the
          trial is still listed as “Ongoing” in at least 1 country. As the name
          suggests, the “Date of the global end of the trial” field is supposed to only be used once
          the trial has completed globally, and match for all country protocols.
          Unfortunately, this is often not the case.</li>
          <li>For certain trials, a protocol or protocols will have no trial status. While
          this can occur for protocols in EU countries (Examples
          <a href= "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2010-022844-19">here<a> and
          <a href= "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2005-001909-25">here</a>),
          this will always occur when a trial includes a protocol for the “Outside EU/EEA”
          portion of the trial (Examples
          <a href= "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2017-000406-38">here</a> and
          <a href= "https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2015-000104-26">here</a>).
          According to the EUCTR, these protocols are “linked to European paediatric-medicine development” and
          due to limitations of the EUCTR, never display a trial status. We have tags
          to separately indicate “No Trial Status on Register” and when a trial contains
          an “Outside EU/EEA” protocol.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>While we cannot accurately assess the status of these trials,
        they may still have results. We note this in the label next to the trials.
        When the fault lies with the sponsor, we think the EU registry managers
        could and should automatically identify trials with inconsistent data,
        as we have done; and then require sponsors to correct their records. </p>

        <h2 id="part-of">What Does Terminated Mean?</h2>

        <p>We have included a tag to identify when trials are “Terminated” for all
        locations (called “Prematurely Ended” on EUCTR). A trial
        that ends early, but enrolled and collected data on patients, is required
        to report results under EU Guidelines. In some instances trials are registered
        on the EUCTR but are withdrawn before starting, and therefore have no data to report.
        The EUCTR provides no way to indicate that a trial never happened. Certain
        <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2011-001801-29/results">older
        trials</a> can work around this shortcoming, but newer trials cannot.
        This is an unfortunate limitation of the EUCTR and may lead to some "withdrawn" trials
        to be listed as "due" on our tracker. We have added the “Terminated” flag to provide
        additional context for trials that ended early. We will still evaluate terminated
        trials as due to report, so as not to miss legitimate trials due to report, but those “Terminated” for all 
        locations will have a tag until the EUCTR system is improved to better handle this issue.</p>

        <h2 id="part-of">What Does Exempt Mean?</h2>

        <p>Some trials in our “Not Due” category would never become due because they
        are identified as a Phase 1 trial that is not part of a Paediatric Investigation Plan.
        These types of trials are not covered by the reporting guideline and are typically
        not made public on the EUCTR. However, some trials meeting this description are available on the EUCTR.
        There may be some reason why these trials are made public and required to report, however
        to remain conservative, we now identify these trials as “Exempt” and they remain in the
        “Not Due” category.</p>

        <h2 id="part-of">What Happens when Sponsors Merge or Split?</h2>

        <p>Over time organisations can merge, change names, or split:
        companies may acquire other companies; universities may join
        together; and so on. If we think an organisation is now
        effectively part of another, we say so at the bottom of its
        page. Conversely, if an organisation now effectively includes
        other organisations, and so is responsible for their trials,
        we list those at the bottom of its page. The trials of the
        smaller organisations are not included in the counts of the
        larger one. We've made every effort to get these relationships
        right; there is no canonical data source on mergers and
        acquisitions; if you think we should update any of our data on
        this, please <a href="#contact">tell us</a>.
